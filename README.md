Movie Website

This is my Project #1 code for the Udacity full stack development course. This project allows you to browse my favourite movies and watch their trailers!

Contents:
    media.py:
        This file contains the class definitions of Movie and also a instance method that allows you to show trailer in a pop up window.
    fresh_tomatoes.py:
        This file takes a list as a parameter and lays out the web page.
    entertainment_center.py:
        This file contains the movie trailer information as well as call both media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py.

Quick Start:
    To start, open entertainment_center.py in IDLE, go to Run -> Run Module.
    You're set! The movie trailer website should pop up in a new window.
